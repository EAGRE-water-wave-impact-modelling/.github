## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

- This organization is created for an EU European Industrial Doctorates project **[Eagre/Aegir: high-seas wave-impact modelling](http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/eagreEUEID/index.html)** (Grant agreement ID: 859983) funded under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions. 
- The overall objective for this project is to create and deliver computational/mathematical modelling tools for solving problems in maritime engineering, based on advanced mathematical/numerical analysis and efficient implementation and testing in a general finite-element simulation environment offered by [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/).
- We are going to use this organization as a platform to share our computational models for different sub-projects, collaborate and communicate with group members as well as external users.
