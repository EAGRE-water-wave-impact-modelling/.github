- This organization is created for an EU European Industrial Doctorates project **[Eagre/Aegir: high-seas wave-impact modelling](http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/eagreEUEID/index.html)** (Grant agreement ID: 859983) funded under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions. 
- The overall objective for this project is to create and deliver computational/mathematical modelling tools for solving problems in maritime engineering, based on advanced mathematical/numerical analysis and efficient implementation and testing in a general finite-element simulation environment offered by [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/).
- We are going to use this organization as a platform to share our computational models for different sub-projects, collaborate and communicate with group members as well as external users.
